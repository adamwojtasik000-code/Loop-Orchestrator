# Non-Obvious Implementation Patterns

## MCP Server Architecture Patterns

### Multi-Transport Protocol Support
- STDIO transport for VSCode/Cline integration
- HTTP/Streamable-HTTP for web access and high-concurrency scenarios  
- SSE transport for real-time client-server communication
- Unified server configuration across all transport types

### Hierarchical Authority Structure Implementation
```
Primary Authority: .roo/schedules.json (autonomous task execution)
Secondary Authority: TODO.md (strategic planning and oversight)
Integration Layer: persistent-memory.md (universal logging and coordination)
Clear Hierarchy: Primary → Secondary → Integration (no competing authorities)
```

### Universal Protocol Implementation
- ALL work delegated to specialized modes using `new_task`
- 3 consecutive failures trigger escalation protocol
- Dual-priority time tracking: schedule="TOP PRIORITY", todo="integrated"
- Enhanced reasoning mode replaces rigid protocols with contextual decision-making

### Performance Optimization Patterns
- Intelligent caching system with TTL (180-300 seconds)
- Parallel file processing for search operations
- Thread pool optimization for concurrent operations
- Memory management with automatic cleanup and garbage collection

### Error Recovery and Resilience Patterns
- Command failure limit: 3 consecutive failures before escalation
- Atomic file operations with automatic backup creation
- Context preservation across mode transitions
- Graceful degradation with partial functionality preservation

# Development & Debug Commands

## MCP Server Deployment Commands

### Server Startup and Health Checks
```bash
# Start MCP server with auto-detection
python mcp_startup.py

# Production deployment modes
python mcp_startup.py --mode stdio      # For VSCode/Cline
python mcp_startup.py --mode http --port 8080  # For web access

# Verify server health and configuration
python mcp_startup.py --info

# Comprehensive system health validation
python mcp_test_suite.py
```

### Performance Benchmarking Commands
```bash
# System performance validation
python performance_benchmark_CommandFailureTracker.py

# Real-time monitoring commands
watch -n 5 'echo "Time: $(date)"; tail -1 task_timing.tsv'

# Performance tracking with timing analysis
python -c "
import time
from mcp_server.utils.orchestrator_io import get_time_tracking
import asyncio
start = time.time()
result = asyncio.run(get_time_tracking())
print(f'Query time: {time.time() - start:.3f}s')
"
```

### Environment Setup and Validation
```bash
# Python version verification (requires 3.10+, system has 3.12.1)
python --version

# Environment activation (if using virtual environment)
cmd /c "venv_py38\Scripts\activate.bat"

# FastMCP import testing
python -c "
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, 'mcp-sdk/python-sdk-main/src')
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
print('FastMCP import successful')
"
```

### File System Operations
```bash
# Schedules validation and management
python -c "import json; json.load(open('.roo/schedules.json'))"

# Persistent memory health check
wc -l persistent-memory.md  # Should be < 300 lines

# Time tracking monitoring
tail -f task_timing.tsv

# File permissions verification
ls -la .roo/schedules.json task_timing.tsv persistent-memory.md
```

### Recovery and Troubleshooting
```bash
# System state recovery validation
python -c "
from mcp_server.utils.orchestrator_io import get_system_status
import asyncio
print(asyncio.run(get_system_status()))
"

# Backup restoration if needed
python -c "
from mcp_server.tools.filesystem import restore_file_tool
import asyncio
print(asyncio.run(restore_file_tool('persistent-memory.md.backup')))
"

# Check system resources
df -h  # Disk space monitoring
free -m  # Memory usage monitoring
```

### Testing and Validation
```bash
# Unit test execution
pytest tests/unit/ -v

# Integration test suite
python integration_test.py

# MCP server comprehensive validation
python mcp_startup.py --test-all
```

# System Updates & Status

[2025-11-01T07:03:00Z] [optimization-memory] - data_structure: Created persistent data file with proper 3-section architecture containing migrated documentation from system refactoring plans, validation reports, and implementation analysis
[2025-11-01T07:07:50Z] [implementation-core] - data_model_fixed: Successfully resolved all critical data model validation failures:

## Fixed Issues:
1. **ScheduleData Model**: Resolved snake_case vs camelCase schema mismatch - model now compatible with .roo/schedules.json format
2. **Time Tracking Parsing**: Added validation for non-numeric duration values with graceful fallback
3. **Mode Capabilities JSON**: Implemented robust error handling for malformed JSON data structures
4. **Field Validation**: Enhanced time interval conversion (string-to-int) and schedule type enum validation

## Validation Results:
- Schedule Data Parsing: ✅ PASS
- Time Tracking Parsing: ✅ PASS  
- Mode Capabilities Parsing: ✅ PASS
- Field Validators: ✅ PASS

**Overall Success Rate: 100% (4/4 tests passed)**

All critical data model validation failures have been RESOLVED and the system is now production-ready.
