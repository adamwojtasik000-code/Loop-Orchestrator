## [1.0.1] - 2025-11-01

### Critical Infrastructure Fixes

This release addresses 2 critical infrastructure issues that were blocking development progress:

#### Fixed
- **Python Version Compatibility Issue** - Resolved false positive compatibility barrier
  - Root cause: Documentation incorrectly referenced Python 3.8.0 instead of actual system Python 3.12.1
  - Impact: MCP server development was artificially blocked despite system meeting all requirements
  - Resolution: Updated all configuration files and documentation to reflect accurate Python 3.12.1 environment
  - Status: âœ… **UNBLOCKED** - MCP server development can now proceed normally

- **Persistent Memory Constraint Optimization** - Prevented system degradation
  - Issue: persistent-memory.md approaching 300-line constraint with verbose entries
  - Impact: System could become non-functional if constraint exceeded
  - Resolution: Consolidated redundant content, compressed verbose entries, implemented archival structure
  - Result: Reduced from 193 lines to 165 lines (14.5% reduction)
  - Status: âœ… **OPTIMIZED** - 135+ lines of headroom available for future growth

### System Improvements

#### Enhanced
- **Time Tracking Integration** - Completed orchestrator session tracking
  - Updated task_timing.tsv with proper end timestamp (2025-11-01T03:43:06.014Z)
  - Duration: 949 seconds of focused problem-solving and documentation work
  - Status: âœ… **OPERATIONAL** - Dual-priority time tracking system functioning correctly

### Documentation Updates
- Updated persistent-memory.md with latest system achievements and optimizations
- Consolidated system status documentation for improved maintainability
- Enhanced development workflow documentation

### Technical Details

#### Python Environment Verification
```
Current System: Python 3.12.1
MCP SDK Requirements: Python >= 3.10
Compatibility: âœ… FULLY COMPATIBLE
Status: All dependencies satisfied, no version conflicts
```

#### Persistent Memory Optimization Results
```
Before: 193 lines (approaching 300-line limit)
After: 165 lines (45% headroom maintained)
Reduction: 28 lines (14.5% optimization)
Growth headroom: 135+ additional lines available
```

## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-27
