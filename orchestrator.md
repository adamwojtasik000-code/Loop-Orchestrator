# Loop-Orchestrator System

## System Overview

The Loop-Orchestrator implements a **production-ready schedule-driven hierarchy** with TODO.md serving as the secondary planning and oversight component. Autonomous schedule execution operates every 10 minutes from `.roo/schedules.json` as the primary task authority, while TODO.md provides strategic planning, oversight, and coordination. The system maintains universal protocols for mode delegation, time tracking, error handling, and environment synchronization across both systems with enhanced reasoning mode for contextual decision-making.

- **Purpose**: Primary source of autonomous task execution with 10-minute intervals
- **Structure**:
  - Automated schedule execution in architect mode with embedded instructions
  - Comprehensive workflow stages: Implementation ‚Üí Validation ‚Üí Quality ‚Üí Integration ‚Üí Planning ‚Üí [Loop]
  - Universal mode delegation using `new_task` for all work
- **Requirements**:
  - Absolute authority for autonomous task execution
  - Time tracking as TOP PRIORITY with atomic operations and file locking
  - Enhanced reasoning mode replaces rigid questioning protocols
  - Universal error handling: 3 failures + escalation triggers

## Schedule-Driven Operational Protocols

### Primary Autonomous Execution
1. **Review schedules.json**: Check active schedule tasks and workflow stages for autonomous execution
2. **Read Persistent Memory**: Load `persistent-memory.md` for system state and TODO coordination context
3. **Check Time Tracking**: Verify `task_timing.tsv` for schedule task enforcement with priority tracking
4. **Mode Verification**: Confirm available modes in `.roomodes` for executing schedule-driven tasks

### Schedule Task Execution Flow
1. **Schedule Task Selection**: Select active task from schedules.json based on workflow stages
2. **Time Tracking Start**: Log task start time to `task_timing.tsv` with priority="schedule" 
3. **Mode Delegation**: Use `new_task` to delegate ALL work to specialized modes (mandatory)
4. **Enhanced Reasoning**: Apply contextual questioning based on task complexity and system state
5. **Data Exchange**: Pass all data between subtasks explicitly, maintaining schedule context
6. **Memory Updates**: Append findings to `persistent-memory.md` with schedule execution format
7. **Universal Error Handling**: Monitor for 3 consecutive failures, trigger escalation if exceeded
8. **Environment Sync**: Sync at key points (implementation, validation, integration) as required
9. **Time Tracking End**: Record completion, calculate duration, validate against schedule requirements
10. **TODO Coordination**: Note relevant planning/oversight items in persistent-memory.md

### Dual-Priority Time Enforcement
- **Schedule Tasks (TOP PRIORITY)**: 
  - Time tracking initiated before any mode transition/task execution
  - Priority="schedule" in task_timing.tsv
  - On failure: abort operation, log to persistent-memory.md, retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
  - Atomic operations with file locking; complete pairs required for analysis
- **TODO Tasks (Integrated Priority)**:
  - Priority="todo" in task_timing.tsv  
  - 3600s default enforcement with explicit exception handling
  - Coordinated through TODO.md planning/oversight role without execution authority
  - Integration with schedule workflow for strategic context

## TODO Integration Patterns

### Secondary Planning and Oversight
- **Strategic Planning**: TODO.md provides planning context and oversight without direct task execution authority
- **Coordination Points**: Reference TODO items during planning stages of schedule workflow
- **Progress Monitoring**: Checklist-based tracking for oversight and strategic planning
- **Context Integration**: Maintain TODO.md context for planning and coordination during schedule execution

### Session Initialization (TODO Coordination)
1. **Review TODO.md**: Check strategic oversight items for coordination context during planning stages
2. **Read Persistent Memory**: Load `persistent-memory.md` for system state and schedule execution context
3. **Check Time Tracking**: Verify `task_timing.tsv` for both schedule and TODO task enforcement
4. **Mode Verification**: Confirm available modes in `.roomodes` for executing tasks

## Version Control Integration

### Commit Process for Successful Operations
All successful refactoring operations must be integrated into version control as a standard workflow component, not executed immediately but documented as a process step.

#### Commit Scope and Classification
- **`refactor:`** for architectural changes, structural modifications, and system reorganization
- **`feat:`** for new features, functionality additions, and capability enhancements
- **`docs:`** for documentation updates, process improvements, and knowledge preservation
- **`fix:`** for bug fixes, corrections, and issue resolution
- **`style:`** for formatting, styling changes, and code organization

#### Commit Message Format Requirements
**Subject Line Format**: `scope: brief description`
- **Scope**: Use conventional commit type prefixes (refactor:, feat:, docs:, fix:, style:)
- **Description**: Clear, concise description of changes (max 50 characters)
- **Examples**:
  - `refactor: update orchestrator workflow integration protocols`
  - `feat: implement commit automation for successful operations`
  - `docs: add version control integration documentation`

#### Body Requirements
**Required Body Content**:
- **Detailed Explanation**: Comprehensive description of changes made
- **File Tracking**: Complete list of all modified files with path references
- **Verification References**: Reference to `CONTRADICTION_RESOLUTION_VALIDATION.md.archived` for validation confirmation
- **Impact Assessment**: Description of workflow impact and integration effects

#### Author Attribution and Branch Management
- **Author**: orchestrator system (automated commit attribution)
- **Branch**: main (primary development branch)
- **Verification Requirements**: All commits must reference validation documentation

#### Commit Integration Workflow
1. **Operation Completion**: Complete successful task execution with all validations passed
2. **File Inventory**: Compile complete list of all modified files and changes
3. **Intelligent Grouping**: Analyze changes and create logical commit groups based on defined criteria
4. **Group Validation**: Ensure each group is complete, self-contained, and follows dependency rules
5. **Commit Construction**: Format commit message with scope, description, and body for each group
6. **Sequential Commits**: Commit each group individually to maintain granular history
7. **Step-by-Step Push**: Push each commit individually with validation between pushes
8. **Push Verification**: Confirm successful push completion before proceeding to next commit

#### Intelligent Commit Grouping
- **Logical Grouping**: Group changes by feature/functionality/refactoring scope for coherent commits
- **File Type Grouping**: Group related files together (docs together, config together, code together)
- **Dependency Grouping**: Group changes that depend on each other to maintain atomic commit integrity
- **Priority Grouping**: Process critical fixes first, then features, then documentation changes
- **Atomic Grouping**: Each group represents a complete, testable change that can stand alone

**Grouping Criteria**:
- **Critical Changes**: System architecture, security, core functionality changes
- **Feature Additions**: New functionality, enhancements, and capability expansions
- **Documentation**: README updates, workflow documentation, API documentation
- **Configuration**: Environment setup, deployment configurations, build configurations
- **Testing**: Test files, validation scripts, testing infrastructure changes
- **Refactoring**: Code organization improvements, performance optimizations, structural changes

#### Step-by-Step Push Process
1. **Group Creation**: Analyze unstaged changes and create logical groups based on defined criteria
2. **Group Validation**: Ensure each group is complete, self-contained, and follows dependency rules
3. **Commit Construction**: Build proper commit messages for each group with verification references
4. **Sequential Commits**: Commit each group individually to maintain granular history
5. **Step-by-Step Push**: Push each commit individually with validation between each push
6. **Push Verification**: Confirm successful push completion before proceeding to next commit

**Step-by-Step Push Requirements**:
- Wait for each push to complete successfully before initiating the next push operation
- Validate remote repository status after each individual push
- Handle push conflicts gracefully with rollback capabilities
- Implement rollback capability for failed pushes to maintain repository integrity
- Track progress for multi-commit operations with comprehensive logging

#### Verification and Validation Integration
- **Reference Validation**: All commit messages must reference `CONTRADICTION_RESOLUTION_VALIDATION.md.archived` for verification
- **Process Documentation**: Commit integration is part of the standard workflow, not immediate execution
- **Quality Assurance**: Commit process ensures all changes are properly documented and validated before integration
- **Group Verification**: Each commit group validated for completeness and atomic integrity before processing
- **Push Validation**: Individual push verification required before proceeding to next commit in sequence
