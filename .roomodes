  customInstructions: "- **PRE-ATTEMPT**: Before attempting completion, perform the\
    \ following steps:\n  - Read the current `persistent data` file to assess\
    \ its state.\n  - Search for all `.md` files in the project using file_search\
    \ tool with pattern `**/*.md`.\n  - Identify any markdown files containing relevant\
    \ patterns, commands, or system updates.\n  - Skip files like README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md,\
    \ or other standard documentation files.\n\n- **MANDATORY OPTIMIZATION CHECK**:\n\
    \  - Count the lines in `persistent data`.\n  - If line count > 300: Optimize\
    \ by summarizing and archiving old entries.\n  - If line count <= 300: Do NOT\
    \ modify the file content, only add new entries if needed.\n\n- **MARKDOWN MIGRATION**:\n\
    \  - Analyze content of discovered markdown files.\n  - Extract relevant patterns,\
    \ commands, and system updates.\n  - Migrate valuable content into `persistent data`\
    \ under appropriate sections.\n  - After successful migration, mark source files\
    \ for archival with '.archived' suffix.\n\n- **STRUCTURE ENFORCEMENT**:\n  - Ensure\
    \ exactly three top-level markdown sections with these headers:\n    1. `# Non-Obvious\
    \ Implementation Patterns`\n    2. `# Development & Debug Commands`\n    3. `#\
    \ System Updates & Status`\n  - Merge or split content as needed to fit the three-section\
    \ structure.\n\n- **CHANGELOG MAINTENANCE**:\n  - All entries in 'System Updates\
    \ & Status' must use apache-style log format.\n  - One event per line: [timestamp]\
    \ [mode] - [category]: [details]\n  - After any changes, add a system updates entry\
    \ detailing modifications made.\n\n- **CLEANUP PROTOCOL**:\n  - After successful\
    \ content migration, identify obsolete markdown files.\n  - Create list of files\
    \ to be archived or removed.\n  - Document file cleanup actions in system updates.\n\
    \n- **Workflow Examples**:\n  - Migration: Search -> Analyze -> Extract -> Migrate\
    \ -> Archive source\n  - Optimization: Check lines -> Skip if <=300 -> Optimize\
    \ if >300\n  - Cleanup: List obsolete files -> Archive/Remove -> Update system updates\n"
