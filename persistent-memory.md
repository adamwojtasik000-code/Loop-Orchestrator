# Non-Obvious Implementation Patterns

## Core Implementation Patterns
- **Event-Driven Polling**: Use timed polling loops in main thread for updates instead of threading
- **Sequential Resource Rotation**: Increment resource index circularly on errors rather than random selection
- **Conditional Delay Mechanisms**: Implement delays on specific conditions before operations
- **Response Parsing**: Remove unwanted tags from external responses
- **Dynamic Dependency Management**: Auto-install missing packages via subprocess during startup
- **Spherical Thought Graph Patterns**: 3D spherical coordinate system (azimuth θ, elevation φ, radius r) for thought organization, atomic graph operations with rollback, parallel speculative execution with dependency validation, temporal vector-based node activation, and hierarchical planning decomposition

## TODO Integration and Architecture Patterns
- **Task Management Centralization**: TODO.md as core component for task tracking, workflow orchestration, and developer checklists with checklist-driven development, time tracking enforcement (3600s default), and priority-based task organization
- **Workflow Integration**: Task creation, progress tracking, timeout audit, runtime enforcement, and CI integration workflows with specific commands, notes, and deliverables in task descriptions
- **System Architecture**: Multi-technology stacks with UI logic integration, filesystem-based state management, external process dependencies, cache-driven processing, implicit configuration dependencies, and comprehensive error recovery systems
- **Project Structure**: Autoloading mechanisms with fallbacks, complex endpoint management with validation and rate limiting, automated deployment pipelines using version control
- **Runtime Debugging**: State synchronization issues, thread blocking, multi-system consistency verification, endpoint failure handling, background task monitoring, and multi-technology stack debugging patterns
- **Recovery Procedures**: Multi-level recovery strategies with rollback capabilities and mode-switching for emergency scenarios
- **Graph Transformation Patterns**: Aggregate/merge operations for consolidating multiple thoughts, refine operations for feedback-driven improvements, generate operations for producing new idea branches, speculative execution with resource-aware pruning, and real-time orchestration with context-aware activation

## Mode-Specific Architecture Patterns
- **GUI Processing Coupling**: Processing logic embedded in GUI event loop despite separation attempts (architect mode)
- **Hidden Runtime Dependencies**: Cache files or state files critical for operation but not visible in repository (ask mode)
- **Integration Layer Disguises**: Components appearing as examples are actually production integration layers (debug mode)
- **UI Integration Patterns**: Core scripts appearing headless may include GUI components that require main thread execution (ask mode)
- **Misleading File Structure**: Repositories may contain multiple technology stacks despite names suggesting single technology focus (ask mode)
- **Background Processing Silent Failures**: Processing queues may fail silently; check logs and queue system status (debug mode)
- **Model Cooldown Silent Failures**: Model state files timestamps cause silent blocking; check Unix time comparisons for debugging (debug mode)
- **Emergency Recovery Procedures**: Complex multi-mode recovery with rollback capabilities (debug mode)

# Development & Debug Commands

- **Command Failure Recovery Pattern**: Multiple instances of command failure tracking with context logging, failed command sequences, and successful recovery commands documented
- **Spherical Thought Graph Commands**: Graph operations (aggregate, refine, generate), visualization controls (rotation, selection, filtering), API queries (node search, relationship analysis), and integration commands (schedule sync, persistent memory migration)
## Common Commands
- Test Runner: Execute project test suite with standard configuration
- Parallel Execution: Run tests in parallel with configurable process limits

## Critical Command Patterns
- **Parallel Execution Strategies**: Use custom parallel execution for testing with process limits and dependency validation
- **Graph Operation Patterns**: Atomic transformations with rollback, speculative execution with resource limits, and real-time orchestration with activation thresholds

## TODO Management Commands
- **Timeout Audit Command**: grep -r "timeout\|max_time" . --include="*.py" --include="*.yaml" --include="*.json" to identify timeout configurations across the repository
- **Graph Performance Command**: Benchmark graph operations with 100ms traversal targets, 30 FPS visualization, and <50ms activation operations

- Command: python -m unittest test_CommandFailureTracker.py -v
- Achievement: All 12 tests passed successfully, including edge cases and error conditions
- Insight: Unit tests validate the command failure tracking mechanism thoroughly, ensuring reliability in production use
- **Runtime Enforcement Command**: Implement a monitoring hook in orchestrator that tracks task start/end times and compares against configured max runtime limits
- **CI Check Command**: Add a CI script that validates timeout values in configuration files, failing builds with values >3600s unless marked with exemption flags
