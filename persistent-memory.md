# non obvious patterns

## Core Implementation Patterns
- **Event-Driven Polling**: Use timed polling loops in main thread for updates instead of threading
- **Sequential Resource Rotation**: Increment resource index circularly on errors rather than random selection
- **Conditional Delay Mechanisms**: Implement delays on specific conditions before operations
- **Response Parsing**: Remove unwanted tags from external responses
- **Dynamic Dependency Management**: Auto-install missing packages via subprocess during startup
- **Python Version Dependencies**: External SDK compatibility validation, environment isolation strategies, version-specific dependency management for MCP SDK (≥3.10 requirement). Current system uses Python 3.8.0, making MCP server development impossible without upgrade to Python 3.10+. MCP SDK requires anyio>=4.5, httpx>=0.27.1, httpx-sse>=0.4, pydantic>=2.11.0,<3.0.0, starlette>=0.27, python-multipart>=0.0.9, sse-starlette>=1.6.1, pydantic-settings>=2.5.2, uvicorn>=0.31.1, jsonschema>=4.20.0, pywin32>=310; Fallback server available for Python 3.8+ using custom JSON-RPC implementation without additional dependencies
- **Spherical Thought Graph Patterns**: 3D spherical coordinate system (azimuth θ, elevation φ, radius r) for thought organization, atomic graph operations with rollback, parallel speculative execution with dependency validation, temporal vector-based node activation, and hierarchical planning decomposition

## TODO Integration and Architecture Patterns
- **Task Management Centralization**: TODO.md as core component for task tracking, workflow orchestration, and developer checklists with checklist-driven development, time tracking enforcement (3600s default), and priority-based task organization
- **Workflow Integration**: Task creation, progress tracking, timeout audit, runtime enforcement, and CI integration workflows with specific commands, notes, and deliverables in task descriptions
- **System Architecture**: Multi-technology stacks with UI logic integration, filesystem-based state management, external process dependencies, cache-driven processing, implicit configuration dependencies, and comprehensive error recovery systems
- **Project Structure**: Autoloading mechanisms with fallbacks, complex endpoint management with validation and rate limiting, automated deployment pipelines using version control
- **Runtime Debugging**: State synchronization issues, thread blocking, multi-system consistency verification, endpoint failure handling, background task monitoring, and multi-technology stack debugging patterns
- **Recovery Procedures**: Multi-level recovery strategies with rollback capabilities and mode-switching for emergency scenarios
- **Graph Transformation Patterns**: Aggregate/merge operations for consolidating multiple thoughts, refine operations for feedback-driven improvements, generate operations for producing new idea branches, speculative execution with resource-aware pruning, and real-time orchestration with context-aware activation

## Mode-Specific Architecture Patterns
- **GUI Processing Coupling**: Processing logic embedded in GUI event loop despite separation attempts (architect mode)
- **Hidden Runtime Dependencies**: Cache files or state files critical for operation but not visible in repository (ask mode)
- **Integration Layer Disguises**: Components appearing as examples are actually production integration layers (debug mode)
- **UI Integration Patterns**: Core scripts appearing headless may include GUI components that require main thread execution (ask mode)
- **Misleading File Structure**: Repositories may contain multiple technology stacks despite names suggesting single technology focus (ask mode)
- **Background Processing Silent Failures**: Processing queues may fail silently; check logs and queue system status (debug mode)
- **Model Cooldown Silent Failures**: Model state files timestamps cause silent blocking; check Unix time comparisons for debugging (debug mode)
- **Emergency Recovery Procedures**: Complex multi-mode recovery with rollback capabilities (debug mode)

# Development & Debug Commands

- **Command Failure Recovery Pattern**: Multiple instances of command failure tracking with context logging, failed command sequences, and successful recovery commands documented. Benchmark resilience testing shows 30 consecutive command failure sequences with consistent recovery using recovery_cmd, demonstrating robust error handling in resilience test contexts
- **Spherical Thought Graph Commands**: Graph operations (aggregate, refine, generate), visualization controls (rotation, selection, filtering), API queries (node search, relationship analysis), and integration commands (schedule sync, persistent memory migration)
## Common Commands
- Test Runner: Execute project test suite with standard configuration
- Parallel Execution: Run tests in parallel with configurable process limits

## Critical Command Patterns
- **Parallel Execution Strategies**: Use custom parallel execution for testing with process limits and dependency validation
- **Graph Operation Patterns**: Atomic transformations with rollback, speculative execution with resource limits, and real-time orchestration with activation thresholds

## TODO Management Commands
- **Timeout Audit Command**: grep -r "timeout\|max_time" . --include="*.py" --include="*.yaml" --include="*.json" to identify timeout configurations across the repository
- **Python Version Validation Command**: python -c "import sys; print(f'Current: Python {sys.version_info}'); print('MCP SDK requires: >=3.10')" to validate Python version compatibility for external integrations
- **Graph Performance Command**: Benchmark graph operations with 100ms traversal targets, 30 FPS visualization, and <50ms activation operations
- **Runtime Enforcement Command**: Implement a monitoring hook in orchestrator that tracks task start/end times and compares against configured max runtime limits
- **CI Check Command**: Add a CI script that validates timeout values in configuration files, failing builds with values >3600s unless marked with exemption flags
- **MCP Server Commands**: python mcp_startup.py --info (server compatibility check), python mcp_startup.py (automatic mode detection and startup), python mcp_startup.py --mode stdio (stdio mode for VSCode/Cline), from orchestrator import start_mcp_server_if_available (background startup from orchestrator), python mcp_startup.py --mode http --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 (HTTP mode with custom host/port)
- **MCP Server Startup Validation**: python mcp_startup.py --info returns JSON with python_version, python_compatible, server_running, server_pid, server_mode fields for compatibility assessment and status monitoring
