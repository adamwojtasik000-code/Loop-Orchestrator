# Non-Obvious Implementation Patterns

## Core Implementation Patterns
- **Event-Driven Polling**: Use timed polling loops in main thread for updates instead of threading
- **Sequential Resource Rotation**: Increment resource index circularly on errors rather than random selection
- **Conditional Delay Mechanisms**: Implement delays on specific conditions before operations
- **Response Parsing**: Remove unwanted tags from external responses
- **Dynamic Dependency Management**: Auto-install missing packages via subprocess during startup
- **Python Version Dependencies**: System Python 3.12.1 EXCEEDS MCP SDK requirements (≥3.10). MCP SDK requires: anyio≥4.5, httpx≥0.27.1, httpx-sse≥0.4, pydantic≥2.11.0,<3.0.0, starlette≥0.27, python-multipart≥0.0.9, sse-starlette≥1.6.1, pydantic-settings≥2.5.2, uvicorn≥0.31.1, jsonschema≥4.20.0, pywin32≥310; Fallback server available for Python 3.8+ using custom JSON-RPC implementation without additional dependencies
- **Spherical Thought Graph Patterns**: 3D spherical coordinate system (azimuth θ, elevation φ, radius r) for thought organization, atomic graph operations with rollback, parallel speculative execution with dependency validation, temporal vector-based node activation, and hierarchical planning decomposition

## Schedule-Driven Architecture Patterns
- **Hierarchical Task Authority**: schedules.json as primary task authority for autonomous execution, TODO.md as secondary planning and oversight component
- **Dual-Priority Time Tracking**: Schedule tasks use TOP PRIORITY atomic operations with file locking, TODO tasks use integrated 3600s enforcement
- **Enhanced Reasoning Mode**: Replaces rigid 3-question protocol with contextual decision-making based on task complexity and system state
- **Universal Mode Delegation**: ALL work delegated to specialized modes using `new_task` for both schedule and TODO workflows
- **Autonomous Schedule Execution**: 10-minute interval execution with comprehensive workflow stages and persistent memory integration
- **Universal Error Handling**: 3 consecutive failures trigger escalation with rollback procedures across both systems
- **Persistent Memory Integration**: Universal logging format for both schedule execution and TODO coordination with structured timestamp entries

## TODO Integration and Architecture Patterns
- **Task Management Coordination**: TODO.md as secondary component for strategic planning and oversight without direct task execution authority
- **Workflow Integration**: Task creation, progress tracking, timeout audit, runtime enforcement, and CI integration workflows coordinated with schedule-driven execution
- **System Architecture**: Multi-technology stacks with UI logic integration, filesystem-based state management, external process dependencies, cache-driven processing, implicit configuration dependencies, and comprehensive error recovery systems coordinated across both hierarchical systems
- **Project Structure**: Autoloading mechanisms with fallbacks, complex endpoint management with validation and rate limiting, automated deployment pipelines using version control, coordinated between autonomous schedule execution and TODO planning oversight
- **Runtime Debugging**: State synchronization issues, thread blocking, multi-system consistency verification, endpoint failure handling, background task monitoring, and multi-technology stack debugging patterns for dual-system coordination
- **Recovery Procedures**: Multi-level recovery strategies with rollback capabilities and mode-switching for emergency scenarios across both schedule-driven and TODO-coordinated workflows
- **Graph Transformation Patterns**: Aggregate/merge operations for consolidating multiple thoughts, refine operations for feedback-driven improvements, generate operations for producing new idea branches, speculative execution with resource-aware pruning, and real-time orchestration with context-aware activation coordinated through schedule-driven hierarchy

## Mode-Specific Architecture Patterns
- **GUI Processing Coupling**: Processing logic embedded in GUI event loop despite separation attempts (architect mode)
- **Hidden Runtime Dependencies**: Cache files or state files critical for operation but not visible in repository (ask mode)
- **Integration Layer Disguises**: Components appearing as examples are actually production integration layers (debug mode)
- **UI Integration Patterns**: Core scripts appearing headless may include GUI components that require main thread execution (ask mode)
- **Misleading File Structure**: Repositories may contain multiple technology stacks despite names suggesting single technology focus (ask mode)
- **Background Processing Silent Failures**: Processing queues may fail silently; check logs and queue system status (debug mode)
- **Model Cooldown Silent Failures**: Model state files timestamps cause silent blocking; check Unix time comparisons for debugging (debug mode)
- **Emergency Recovery Procedures**: Complex multi-mode recovery with rollback capabilities (debug mode)

# Development & Debug Commands

## Common Commands
- Test Runner: Execute project test suite with standard configuration
- Parallel Execution: Run tests in parallel with configurable process limits

## Critical Command Patterns
- **Parallel Execution Strategies**: Use custom parallel execution for testing with process limits and dependency validation
- **Graph Operation Patterns**: Atomic transformations with rollback, speculative execution with resource limits, and real-time orchestration with activation thresholds

## Schedule-Driven System Commands
- **Schedule Verification**: Verify schedules.json active tasks and next execution times
- **Priority Tracking**: Monitor dual-priority time tracking system (schedule="TOP PRIORITY", todo="integrated")
- **Enhanced Reasoning**: Apply contextual questioning based on task complexity instead of rigid protocols
- **Universal Delegation**: Ensure ALL work delegated to specialized modes using `new_task`
- **Memory Integration**: Coordinate persistent-memory.md updates for both schedule execution and TODO coordination
- **Error Escalation**: Monitor for 3 consecutive failures with automatic escalation triggers

## Dual-System Coordination Commands
- **Authority Hierarchy Check**: Verify schedules.json primary authority and TODO.md secondary oversight role
- **Time Tracking Validation**: Confirm priority column usage and enforcement differences between systems
- **Workflow Stage Coordination**: Validate Implementation → Validation → Quality → Integration → Planning → [Loop] progression
- **Persistent Memory Sync**: Ensure universal logging format works for both workflow types
- **Environment Synchronization**: Coordinate sync points across both autonomous execution and TODO planning

## TODO Management Commands (Secondary Role)
- **Timeout Audit Command**: grep -r "timeout\|max_time" . --include="*.py" --include="*.yaml" --include="*.json" to identify timeout configurations across the repository
- **Python Version Validation Command**: python -c "import sys; print(f'Current: Python {sys.version_info}'); print('MCP SDK requires: >=3.10')" to validate Python version compatibility for external integrations
- **Graph Performance Command**: Benchmark graph operations with 100ms traversal targets, 30 FPS visualization, and <50ms activation operations
- **Runtime Enforcement Command**: Implement a monitoring hook in orchestrator that tracks task start/end times and compares against configured max runtime limits
- **CI Check Command**: Add a CI script that validates timeout values in configuration files, failing builds with values >3600s unless marked with exemption flags
- **MCP Server Commands**:
  - `python mcp_startup.py --info` - Server compatibility check and status display
  - `python mcp_startup.py` - Automatic mode detection and startup
  - `python mcp_startup.py --mode stdio` - Stdio mode for VSCode/Cline integration
  - `python mcp_startup.py --mode http` - HTTP mode for web-based access
  - `python mcp_startup.py --mode http --port 8080` - HTTP mode with custom port
  - Start from orchestrator: `from mcp_server.main import start_mcp_server_if_available`
- **MCP Server Startup Validation**:
  - `python mcp_startup.py --info` returns JSON with server configuration
  - Validates Python 3.12.1 compatibility and all server files
  - Checks MCP SDK availability and environment setup
- **MCP Server Integration Testing**:
  - Test all 20 tools with proper error conditions
  - Verify integration with Loop-Orchestrator files
  - Validate time tracking and persistent memory operations
  - Test mode coordination workflows
- **MCP Server Production Deployment**:
  - All tools operational with comprehensive error handling
  - 3-failure escalation protocol implemented
  - Automatic backup and rollback procedures
  - Full integration with existing orchestrator system
