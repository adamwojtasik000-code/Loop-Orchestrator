# Non-Obvious Implementation Patterns

## Core Implementation Patterns
- **Event-Driven Polling**: Use timed polling loops in main thread for updates instead of threading
- **Sequential Resource Rotation**: Increment resource index circularly on errors rather than random selection
- **Conditional Delay Mechanisms**: Implement delays on specific conditions before operations
- **Response Parsing**: Remove unwanted tags from external responses
- **Dynamic Dependency Management**: Auto-install missing packages via subprocess during startup

## TODO Integration Patterns
- **Task Management Centralization**: TODO.md serves as the central component for task tracking, workflow orchestration, and developer checklists
- **Checklist-Driven Development**: Maintain developer-focused checklists with small, actionable items and checkbox progress tracking
- **Time Tracking Enforcement**: Implement runtime limits (default 3600s) for tasks with automated checks and enforcement mechanisms
- **Priority-Based Task Organization**: Structure tasks by priority levels (high, implementation) with clear acceptance criteria
- **Command Documentation in Tasks**: Include specific commands, notes, and deliverables directly in task descriptions for actionable workflows

## System Architecture Patterns
- **UI Logic Integration**: Processing logic embedded in UI event loop despite separation attempts
- **Filesystem-Based State**: Runtime files replace database despite backend availability
- **External Process Dependencies**: Missing packages installed via external processes instead of proper management
- **Cache-Driven Processing**: Architecture centered around cache misses rather than data flow optimization
- **Multi-Technology Architecture**: Legacy GUI + modern plugin production system despite single-repo structure
- **Implicit Configuration Dependencies**: Configuration files critical for operation but not visible in repo
- **Framework Integration Layers**: Framework components appear as examples but are live integration layers
- **Multi-Queue Processing Systems**: Scheduler + custom queue system with graceful degradation fallback
- **Comprehensive Error Recovery System**: Multi-layer error handling with autoloading fallbacks and endpoint redundancy

## Project Structure Patterns
- **Autoloading Mechanisms with Fallbacks**: Framework uses autoloading with fallback mechanisms for missing dependencies
- **Endpoint Management Complexity**: Multiple endpoints with complex validation and rate limiting across architecture

## Deployment Patterns
- **Automated Deployment Pipeline**: Continuous deployment using version control and authentication mechanisms

## Runtime Debugging Patterns
- **State Synchronization Issues**: Check timestamp comparisons for timing-related failures
- **UI Thread Blocking**: Main thread operations causing interface freezes
- **Multi-System Consistency**: Verify state across different technology components
- **Endpoint Failure Handling**: Inspect rate limiting and fallback logic during service failures
- **Background Task Failures**: Monitor queue systems and logging for silent errors
- **Model Cooldown Silent Failures**: Model state files timestamps cause silent blocking; check Unix time comparisons for debugging
- **GUI Update Freezes**: GUI update calls in main thread prevent locks, but block event processing unexpectedly
- **Multi-Technology Stack Debugging**: Hybrid technology systems require checking multiple state files for consistency

## Emergency Recovery Procedures
- **Multi-Level Recovery Strategies**: Implement recovery procedures with rollback and mode-switching capabilities
- **Complex Multi-Mode Recovery**: Multi-mode recovery with rollback capabilities

## TODO Integration Workflows
- **Task Creation Workflow**: Add new development tasks to TODO.md with specific action items, acceptance criteria, and deliverable descriptions
- **Progress Tracking Workflow**: Update task status using checkboxes, include completion notes and executed commands for transparency
- **Timeout Audit Workflow**: Search repository for timeout configurations (timeout, max_time fields), compile list of tasks needing timeout adjustments or justifications
- **Runtime Enforcement Workflow**: Implement orchestrator guards that monitor task execution time, failing or warning when exceeding 3600s default unless explicitly exempted
- **CI Integration Workflow**: Add automated CI checks that scan configuration files for timeout values exceeding 3600s, providing warnings or failures with review exemption options

- **Command Failure Recovery**: Context: , Failed commands: ['cmd1', 'cmd2', 'cmd3'], Successful command: cmd
- **Command Failure Recovery**: Context: , Failed commands: ['cmd1', 'cmd2', 'cmd3'], Successful command: cmd
## Common Commands
- Test Runner: Execute project test suite with standard configuration
- Parallel Execution: Run tests in parallel with configurable process limits

## Critical Command Patterns
- **Parallel Execution Strategies**: Use custom parallel execution for testing with process limits

## TODO Management Commands
- **Timeout Audit Command**: grep -r "timeout\|max_time" . --include="*.py" --include="*.yaml" --include="*.json" to identify timeout configurations across the repository
