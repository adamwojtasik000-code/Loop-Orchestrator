## Phase 1: Foundation Refactoring (COMPLETED)

### Architecture Reformation
**Timeline:** October-November 2025  
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE

#### Hierarchical Authority Structure
- **Primary Authority**: `.roo/schedules.json` for autonomous task execution
- **Secondary Authority**: `TODO.md` for strategic planning and oversight
- **Integration Layer**: `persistent-memory.md` for universal logging
- **Clear Hierarchy**: Primary â†’ Secondary â†’ Integration (no competing authorities)

#### Universal Protocol Implementation
- **Mode Delegation**: ALL work delegated to specialized modes using `new_task`
- **Error Handling**: 3 consecutive failures trigger escalation protocol
- **Time Tracking**: Dual-priority system (schedule="TOP PRIORITY", todo="integrated")
- **Enhanced Reasoning**: Contextual decision-making replacing rigid protocols
- **Environment Sync**: Synchronization at implementation, validation, integration stages

### Contradiction Resolution (COMPLETED)

#### 1. âœ… Task Source Contradiction - RESOLVED
- **Previous Issue**: schedules.json vs orchestrator.md competing for task initiation authority
- **Resolution**: Hierarchical system with schedules.json as primary authority, TODO.md as secondary planning
- **Implementation**: Clear hierarchy established, no competing authorities
- **Validation**: âœ… Hierarchical relationship functioning correctly

#### 2. âœ… Workflow Stage Contradiction - RESOLVED
- **Previous Issue**: schedules.json started with implementation vs orchestrator.md started with planning
- **Resolution**: Unified workflow: Implementation â†’ Validation â†’ Quality â†’ Integration â†’ Planning â†’ [Loop]
- **Implementation**: Both systems reference identical progression stages
- **Validation**: âœ… Consistent workflow stages across all systems

#### 3. âœ… Mode Delegation Contradiction - RESOLVED
- **Previous Issue**: schedules.json required ALL delegation vs orchestrator.md conditional delegation
- **Resolution**: Universal protocol - ALL work delegated to specialized modes
- **Implementation**: Single delegation approach across entire system
- **Validation**: âœ… Universal delegation working correctly

#### 4. âœ… Automation Contradiction - RESOLVED
- **Previous Issue**: schedules.json autonomous execution vs orchestrator.md manual oversight
- **Resolution**: Primary automation maintained, oversight moved to secondary planning role
- **Implementation**: Autonomous execution with strategic planning integration
- **Validation**: âœ… Autonomous operation with planning oversight

#### 5. âœ… Time Tracking Priority Contradiction - RESOLVED
- **Previous Issue**: schedules.json TOP PRIORITY vs orchestrator.md integrated system
- **Resolution**: Dual-priority system with distinct enforcement mechanisms
- **Implementation**: Schedule tasks = "TOP PRIORITY", TODO tasks = "integrated"
- **Validation**: âœ… Dual-priority system functioning correctly

#### 6. âœ… Question Protocol Contradiction - RESOLVED
- **Previous Issue**: schedules.json rigid 3-question requirement vs orchestrator.md no explicit protocol
- **Resolution**: Enhanced reasoning mode with contextual decision-making
- **Implementation**: Adaptive protocol based on actual need, not rigid requirements
- **Validation**: âœ… Contextual decision-making operational
