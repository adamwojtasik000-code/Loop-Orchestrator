# Contradictions Analysis: schedules.json vs orchestrator.md

## Executive Summary

Analysis of `.roo/schedules.json` and `orchestrator.md` reveals **6 major contradictions** that create significant operational conflicts between two competing system paradigms: **schedule-driven automation** vs **TODO-driven manual workflow**.

## Major Contradictions Identified

### 1. TASK SOURCE CONTRADICTION ⚠️ CRITICAL

**schedules.json (Lines 4-7)**:
- **Directive**: "Delegate ALL work to specialized modes using `new_task`"
- **Task Source**: Automated schedule every 10 minutes with embedded instructions
- **Execution**: Direct mode delegation from schedule-driven triggers

**orchestrator.md (Lines 5, 119-123)**:
- **Directive**: "All development work originates from TODO.md checklist items"
- **Task Source**: Manual TODO.md checklist items with acceptance criteria
- **Execution**: Checklist-driven workflow initiation

**CONTRADICTION**: 
- schedules.json promotes schedule-based autonomous operation
- orchestrator.md mandates TODO.md as the single source of truth
- **Impact**: Creates competing authorities for task initiation

### 2. WORKFLOW STAGE CONTRADICTION ⚠️ CRITICAL

**schedules.json (Lines 4-7)**:
- **Workflow**: "Implementation → Validation → Quality → Integration → Planning → [Loop]"
- **Direction**: Linear progression with loop back to implementation
- **Focus**: Execution-centric with continuous implementation cycle

**orchestrator.md (Lines 114-117)**:
- **Workflow**: "Planning → Delegation → Monitoring → Completion → Verification"
- **Direction**: Planning-first approach with verification completion
- **Focus**: TODO-centric with planning and verification bookends

**CONTRADICTION**:
- schedules.json starts with implementation
- orchestrator.md starts with planning
- **Impact**: Opposing entry points create decision paralysis

### 3. MODE DELEGATION CONTRADICTION ⚠️ HIGH

**schedules.json (Lines 22-57)**:
- **Instruction**: "MANDATORY: Delegate ALL work to specialized modes using `new_task`"
- **Delegation**: Direct delegation to specialized modes for all tasks
- **Depth**: "Subtasks create subtasks for complex work (max depth 5)"

**orchestrator.md (Lines 84-87)**:
- **Instruction**: "Use `new_task` to delegate work to specialized modes aligned with TODO item categories"
- **Delegation**: Conditional delegation based on TODO item alignment
- **Depth**: Resource allocation with 50% of parent allocation

**CONTRADICTION**:
- schedules.json: ALL work must be delegated
- orchestrator.md: Delegation aligned with TODO categories
- **Impact**: Over-delegation vs selective delegation approach

### 4. AUTOMATION CONTRADICTION ⚠️ HIGH

**schedules.json (Lines 9-10, 28-34)**:
- **Execution**: Automatic every 10 minutes regardless of task state
- **Trigger**: Time-based schedule (lastExecutionTime: 2025-11-01T02:23:15.326Z)
- **Behavior**: "wait" taskInteraction with inactivityDelay: "3"
- **Autonomy**: Self-executing workflow without manual intervention

**orchestrator.md (Lines 77-91)**:
- **Execution**: Manual initiation from TODO.md checklist selection
- **Trigger**: Human selection of active TODO items
- **Behavior**: Human-driven task selection and mode verification
- **Control**: Manual oversight of all operations

**CONTRADICTION**:
- schedules.json: Autonomous schedule execution
- orchestrator.md: Manual human oversight and selection
- **Impact**: Creates automated vs manual control conflict

### 5. TIME TRACKING PRIORITY CONTRADICTION ⚠️ MEDIUM

**schedules.json (Lines 19-22)**:
- **Priority**: "Time Tracking (TOP PRIORITY)"
- **Implementation**: "Start `⏱️ Task Time Tracking` and record timing before any transition"
- **Requirement**: "Atomic operations with file locking; complete pairs required for analysis"
- **Failure Handling**: "abort operation, log to relevant sources, retry up to 3 times"

**orchestrator.md (Lines 22-30, 84-91)**:
- **Priority**: Part of comprehensive time tracking system with runtime enforcement
- **Implementation**: Log task start time to `task_timing.tsv` with 3600s enforcement
- **Requirement**: Automatic logging for all mode transitions with status tracking
- **Failure Handling**: Runtime guards fail or warn when exceeding 3600s

**CONTRADICTION**:
- schedules.json: Time tracking as standalone TOP PRIORITY operation
- orchestrator.md: Time tracking integrated as system component
- **Impact**: Priority inflation vs integrated approach

### 6. QUESTION PROTOCOL CONTRADICTION ⚠️ MEDIUM

**schedules.json (Lines 65-70)**:
- **Pre-Transition**: "≥3 clarifying questions before each major process transition"
- **Post-Completion**: "Validate understanding after each phase completion"
- **Backtrack**: "Questions about root causes when loops occur"
- **Knowledge**: "Questions about what insights to preserve"

**orchestrator.md (Lines 101-103)**:
- **Questions**: Not explicitly mentioned as protocol requirement
- **Focus**: Checklist completion and acceptance criteria validation
- **Error Handling**: Command failure tracking and memory integrity verification

**CONTRADICTION**:
- schedules.json: Mandatory 3+ questions before transitions
- orchestrator.md: No explicit question protocol
- **Impact**: Structured questioning vs criteria-based validation

## System Architecture Conflicts

### Competing Core Paradigms

**Schedule-Driven Automation** (schedules.json):
- Time-triggered autonomous execution
- Mode-based delegation system
- Loop-based continuous improvement
- Predefined workflow stages

**TODO-Driven Manual Workflow** (orchestrator.md):
- Human-initiated checklist execution
- Priority-based task selection
- Planning-first approach
- Acceptance criteria validation

### Integration Points Failure

**No Clear Bridge**:
- schedules.json assumes autonomous operation
- orchestrator.md assumes manual oversight
- No mechanism to reconcile competing authorities
- Both claim to be the "core" or "central" system

## Operational Impact Analysis

### Immediate Conflicts

1. **Decision Paralysis**: Two competing systems for task initiation
2. **Workflow Confusion**: Opposing stage progressions create uncertainty
3. **Authority Conflicts**: Schedule automation vs TODO checklist control
4. **Resource Allocation**: Different delegation patterns cause inefficiency

### System Reliability Issues

1. **Timing Conflicts**: Automated vs manual time tracking priorities
2. **Error Handling**: Different failure modes and recovery procedures
3. **Data Integrity**: Competing state management approaches
4. **User Experience**: Conflicting instructions and protocols

### Performance Impact

1. **Duplicate Overhead**: Both systems maintain separate state
2. **Coordination Costs**: Manual reconciliation of competing workflows
3. **Training Complexity**: Confusing dual paradigm operation
4. **Maintenance Burden**: Two systems require separate upkeep

## Critical Resolution Requirements

### Immediate Actions Needed

1. **System Hierarchy**: Establish primary/secondary relationship
2. **Unified Protocol**: Merge or eliminate competing workflows
3. **Clear Authority**: Define single source of task initiation
4. **Integration Bridge**: Create seamless handoff between systems

### Recommended Resolution Strategy

**Option A: TODO-Driven Hierarchy**
- Make schedules.json subordinate to orchestrator.md
- schedules.json becomes automated TODO execution
- orchestrator.md controls schedule activation/deactivation

**Option B: Schedule-Driven Hierarchy** 
- Make orchestrator.md subordinate to schedules.json
- orchestrator.md becomes schedule template system
- schedules.json controls TODO item creation and execution

**Option C: Hybrid Integration**
- Merge both systems into unified orchestrator
- schedules.json provides automation triggers
- orchestrator.md provides workflow templates

## Conclusion

The contradictions between `.roo/schedules.json` and `orchestrator.md` represent **fundamental system design conflicts** that undermine operational clarity and reliability. The **schedule-driven automation** paradigm directly contradicts the **TODO-driven manual workflow** approach, creating:

- **6 major contradictions** across task sources, workflows, automation, and protocols
- **Competing authorities** for system control and task initiation
- **Operational confusion** with opposing entry points and workflows
- **Resource inefficiency** through duplicate overhead and coordination costs

**Immediate resolution is required** to establish clear system hierarchy and eliminate these contradictions before they cause system failures or operational paralysis.
